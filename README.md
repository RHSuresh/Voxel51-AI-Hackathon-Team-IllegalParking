About our topic:

Our project revolves around Illegal Parking Detection
We used the CoCo format for the dataset
This dataset contains motor vehicles parked in different scenarios
Each picture within the dataset labels all the cars shown in the picture with bounding boxes
Our goal is to have the AI model identify the cars that are parked illegally and let the moderator (end user) know
